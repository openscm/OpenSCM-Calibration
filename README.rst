OpenSCM-Calibration
===================

Calibration tools for simple climate models (and other things perhaps)

TO-DO:

- tests
- docs
- linting (black, flake8, isort, mypy, pylint, pydocstyle, etc.)
- CI
- notebooks
- installation
- add note about needing poetry to be installed before anything will work (installation instructions here https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer, use pipx or pip to install)
