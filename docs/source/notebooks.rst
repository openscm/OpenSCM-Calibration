Notebooks
---------

Here we provide various examples of how to use OpenSCM-Calibration.
They  are derived from
`jupyter notebooks <https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/start/index.html>`_,
but are saved using `jupytext <https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
to keep our repository slim and make it easier to track changes.
